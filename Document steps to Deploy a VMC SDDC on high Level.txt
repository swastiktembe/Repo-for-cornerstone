Document steps to Deploy a VMC SDDC on high Level

1. Create a VPC

During the creation of the VPC we can define a Name for our VPC and we must define a network range for it.

2. In the next step we will need to configure subnet for our VPC.

In the SUBNET creation dialog fill out the neccesary information per Availibility Zone.

#      select newly created VPC

#      give it a descriptive name

#      choose a Availability Zone

#      enter a network range

#      then create


3. Now we have to Create a SDDC
after Logging into  our vmware infra   

goto Cloud Services Console>> Services>> VMware Cloud on AWS>> SDDCs>> then CREATE SDDC


then defime required infor for creation of the SDDC :

        Region where our SDDC should be located            
        deployment type                                                    
        Host type                                                                   
        SDDC name                                                              
        Number of hosts (cluster size)                                 
        Management Appliance size                                   



4. Now we will tie up SDDC to the AWS account.

Create cloud formation stack creation>> accept the changes to IAM resources by clicking on Create stack>>THen refresh until it fetches and syncs>> once finished switch back to VMware Cloud Console.

Back in VMware Cloud console we shall see, that all the information is now there so proceed further.

here we configure the VPC and the Subnet we configured in the AWS console as we started out.

Now configure the range for our management network, depending on the size of SDDC.

Few things to remember

        No overlapping IP ranges
        No reserved IP큦

 then Deploy SDDC.

 
 It will take min 2-3 hours to have this ready
